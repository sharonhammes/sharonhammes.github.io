I'm beginning, just beginning, to understand the discipline it must take to be a writer. 
During the day ideas come to mind that would be good to explore in a short blog. 
By the time I get home, however, I somehow get into a very "non-productive" state.
I google things, make dinner, fold some clothes, pick up random items to put away, read a bit,
and pretty soon the evening is gone and I have written nothing. Tonight will be different, I thought.
Well, I guess it is. :)
